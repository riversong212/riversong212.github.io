    Hello! My name is Leslie Kim. I am an instructional designer with work experience in higher education and corporate setting. I am a graduate student in the Learning Technologies and Design program at the University of Missouri-Columbia. I plan on graduating from the program this May. This is my first time taking a web design course. My only knowledge of simple web design coding skills using HTML and CSS is from my technology camp counseling experience. I was an assistant counselor for a technology camp course that taught elementary-age children how to code simple HTML and CSS language using software called Mozilla Thimble. I look forward to getting up to speed with learning the coding language I need to create a website. In my free time, I like to go hiking, traveling, and playing board games.
