<p>Education Overview</p>
<p> Hello! My name is Leslie Kim. I live in Fairfax, Virginia. It is an hour away from Washington 
    D.C. I like to travel, go hiking, and play board games in my free time. I have a bachelor’s degree 
    in Middle School Education from Towson University. I am a graduate student in the Learning 
    Technologies and Design program at the University of Missouri-Columbia. I will be completing 
    my master’s degree in spring 2022.<br/>I am an instructional designer with work experience in higher 
    education and corporate setting. I am currently working in a government contracting company as 
    an instructional designer. Through my work experience in various instructional design industries, 
    I have developed online training content for adult learners with different learning needs. I am
