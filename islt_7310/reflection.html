    <h2 class="title">Personal Reflection</h2> 
<h3 class="title">Academic and Career Background</h3>
<p class="body">I started this program one year after completing my bachelor's degree in Education from Towson 
University. Based on my academic interest with my undergraduate course in instructional 
technology and my camp counselor experience at a technology camp, I decided to expand my 
knowledge of learning technology by pursuing a master's degree at the University of Missouri, 
Columbia. During my attendance with this asynchronous program, I have actively engaged in 
online discussions and group projects with other peers to analyze the learning technology 
practices based on our articles and textbook reading. Eventually, I have demonstrated my 
understanding of instructional design through the ISD projects that I created from this program 
during my job interview. At about halfway through the program, I started my first position as an 
instructional designer. While balancing a full-time job and graduate school work at the same 
time was challenging, I was able to improve my time management and organizational skills.</p>
<h3 class="title">Course Program Experience</h3>
<p class="body">I have gained a lot of practical skillsets and expertise in learning theories by taking project-based 
and interactive courses through hands-on activities from this program. Most of my coursework in 
this program involved demonstrating my instructional design skills through real-world projects. 
The skillsets that I developed from this program enabled me to design and develop interactive 
learning experiences supported by learning technology practices. For example, my interaction 
design project was based on the real-life context of creating a resource website to provide 
disability rights information to the employees of the existing organization called Disability 
Justice Coalition (DJC) within the Seattle Public School (SPS) union. Because it was a project 
based on real-life context, the design process of developing the prototype website was more 
engaging and relevant than creating a project based on a hypothetical scenario.</p>
<h3 class="title">Improvements</h3>
<p class="body">Aside from gaining knowledge of the latest learning technology practices, my organizational 
skills with simultaneously handling multiple projects and tasks improved. I developed project 
management strategies to carry out projects with long-term durations. The professors have been 
supportive of my learning process through any guidance I needed for my academic success. I 
now have a much better structure for project-based routines.</p>
<h3 class="title">Career Aspiration</h3> 
<p class="body">As an instructional designer, I am excited to apply learning technology practices from this 
program in real life. I studied education for my undergraduate degree. I was familiar with writing 
learning objectives and designing learning activities based on my learning objectives as an 
education major. However, I lacked an understanding of the design process steps. As an 
instructional designer, I learned that I could conduct a needs assessment to identify the learning 
and training gaps of the target learners. I also learned how to design and develop learning content 
using multimedia and rapid development tools. Now, I am ready to apply my skills as an 
instructional designer to continue designing and developing eLearning modules. While my short-
term goal is to gain more experience in developing eLearning courses as an instructional 
designer, my long-term goal is to incorporate my understanding of user experience practices to 
transition into a learning experience designer.<br><br></p></div>
