        <h2 class="title">Goal 1: Design and Development of Learning Systems</h2>
        <p class="body">Competencies: I am able to design and develop innovative, aesthetic, effective and sustainable 
        learning technologies based on theory-grounded research.<br> 
        Goal 1: To provide students with experiences to develop theory-grounded and research-based 
        competencies for the innovative, aesthetic, effective and sustainable design/development, and 
        management of technologies for learning opportunities and systems.
        <h2 class="title">Artifact: Introduction to Digital Media Portfolio</h2>
        <p class="body">Objective 1.1: Students are able to design/develop learning and performance opportunities and 
        systems including direct instruction, constructivist learning, collaborative work, and performance 
        support.</p><br><br>
        <aside>
            <img src="digital media image.png" alt="Picture" style="width: 400px; height:350px;">
        </aside>
        <p class="body">The digital image, audio, and video in this artifact explain common types of workplace 
        emergencies, the four elements of the Emergency Management Program, and how to develop the 
        Emergency Action Plan according to the Occupation Safety & Health Administration using a 
        website builder tool, Wix. I have compiled all three digital media contents into one learning 
        module with the interactive slides created using Genially to test learners' understanding of the 
        content in the final project page.<br>
        This course was designed based on the theory of constructivism because it involved designing 
        and developing a learning content of my choice using multimedia production techniques in a web 
        portfolio. The artifact addresses direct instruction by using a digital image, audio, and video to 
        explain how to prepare for emergencies in the workplace as an employee.<br>
        One strength of this artifact is the hands-on learning of using various digital media software such 
        as Gimp, Audacity, Screencast-O-Matic, and Genially to design learning content. Using different 
        digital media software to create the website content was an engaging and interactive design 
        process. One weakness of this artifact is my lack of proficiency in photoshop, audio, and video 
        editing skills in my digital media content. Due to the time constraints of completing this artifact 
        in an 8-week course, I could not produce the digital content with higher quality. If I were to work 
        on this project again, I would improve the software skills needed for this project.</p><br>
