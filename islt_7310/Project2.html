        <p class="body">Competencies: I developed critical and analytical skills for data collection and evaluation and 
        can reflect and apply these skills to assess and evaluate learning systems.<br> 
        Goal 2: To provide students with experiences to develop skills in data collection, analysis, and 
        evaluation for reflecting on and applying to the design/development of learning opportunities and 
        systems.
        <h2 class="title">Artifact: Usability of Information Systems and Services Project</h2>
        <p class="body">Objective 2.1: Students are able to conduct analysis in order to translate and use theoretical 
        frameworks and existing research to design/develop learning opportunities and systems.</p>

            <p class="body">The usability testing project consists of a heuristic evaluation report, usability pilot test, and 
            usability test. This assignment was a group project with three other students. As a team, we have 
            been communicating each of our expected contributions to this project. This artifact is an 
            outcome of the active collaboration between our teamwork.<br> 
            In heuristic evaluation, we evaluated the usability of Myzou as a student user based on the 
            standard heuristic evaluation tool developed by Jakob Nielsen. We used a 0-4 scale, 4 being the 
            best score and 0 being the worst score for each heuristic element. We also provided a rationale 
            for our score on each element. In the usability pilot test, we used five tasks that the users can do 
            in Myzou to measure the following performance metrics: task success (also known as task 
            completion; effectiveness), time on task (efficiency), the difficulty of the task, and user 
            satisfaction. Each team member conducted a user observation of their chosen usersâ€™ interaction 
            with Myzou while completing all five tasks. We reported the pilot test results using screenshot 
            images of Myzou, tables, and chart data. As for the usability test, my team members and I have 
            not completed this part of the group project yet. Using the same five tasks on Myzou from the 
            pilot test, my team will create a usability plan and conduct the test on 10-12 users.<br> 
            One strength of this artifact is the high validity of the user observation results based on student 
            researchers who have prior experience with using Myzou as a student. Since my team members 
            and I were conducting usability testing and analyzing heuristic evaluation on a platform that we 
            all had experience with, we were able to assign realistic tasks for our participants to complete. It 
            was also easy to analyze the usability problems that our participants mentioned during the 
            observation as researchers. One weakness of this artifact is the potential bias in the observation 
            result due to the small pool of participant groups in the usability testing. To enhance the 
            credibility of our usability study, we would need more observation data from more users. If I 
            were to work on this project again, I would gather data from more participant groups for this 
            analysis.</p><br>
