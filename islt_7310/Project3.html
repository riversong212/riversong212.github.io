        <h2 class="title">Goal 3: Leadership & Social Responsibility</h2>
        <p class="body">Competencies: I developed competencies for socially responsible technology leadership.<br>
        Goal 3: To provide students with experiences to become socially responsible, reflective/sensitive 
        on the interaction of technologies & society and act ethically in response to current and future 
        challenges of emerging technologies for learning.<br>
        <h2 class="title">Artifact: Interaction Design - Disability Justice Coalition Website</h2> 
        <p class="body">Objective 3.1: Students demonstrate technology leadership and knowledge of ethics as applied to 
        current and future socio-technical context.</p><br>
        
        <aside>
            <img src="DJC Website.png" alt="Picture" style="width: 350px; height:250px;">

            <p class="body">Disability Justice Coalition (DJC) Website project was designed to address the need to 
            decentralize information about disability rights to members of DJC organizations by creating a 
            prototype website using Adobe XD. DJC is an organization within the Seattle Public Schools 
            (SPS) union. The target audiences of this artifact are DJC members who need a website that 
            would provide them with information about the disability rights of employees.
            <br>
            This assignment was a group project with another student. I have demonstrated leadership skills 
            by leading video conferencing sessions to distribute our tasks and communicate the project 
            status. This project involved an iterative process of building, testing, and revising based on our 
            user testing result. Throughout the project, I constantly communicated how to improve our 
            prototype design to look aesthetically more appealing and user-friendly based on the heuristic 
            principles with my team member.<br>
            One strength of this artifact is the thorough process of conducting problem analysis, evaluation 
            reports, low and high-fidelity prototypes, and usability testing to create a website prototype that 
            addresses the need of my target audience. This artifact demonstrates the socio-technical context 
            behind the interaction design problem and the types of heuristic principles to develop this 
            website. I think my artifact shows strength in guiding through the overall design process and 
            design improvements based on our user testing. One weakness of this artifact is the small number 
            of users who participated in the usability testing. Due to time constraints, my team member and I 
            did not have enough time to conduct the usability testing to a larger pool of participants other 
            than the minimum requirement of 3 participants. If I were to work on this project again, I would 
            want to conduct usability testing on more participants to gather more feedback on how to 
            improve my website prototype.</p><br>
